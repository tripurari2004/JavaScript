# JavaScript Learning Guide

This folder contains practical examples and demonstrations of JavaScript operators, covering both **arithmetic** and **comparison** operations.

## 📁 Files Overview

### 1. **Operators.js**
Contains comprehensive examples of JavaScript arithmetic operators and type coercion.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (exponentiation)
- **Type Coercion:** How JavaScript automatically converts types in arithmetic operations
- **Operator Precedence:** Order of operations in complex expressions
- **Unary Operators:** `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement) operators
  - Post-increment/decrement: `x++`, `x--`
  - Pre-increment/decrement: `++x`, `--x`

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
- String concatenation vs. numeric addition
- Automatic type conversion with operators
- Differences between post and pre-increment/decrement operations

### 2. **Comparison.js**
Contains examples of JavaScript comparison operators for different data types.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Numeric Comparisons:** Direct value comparisons between numbers
- **String Comparisons:** Alphabetical ordering based on Unicode/ASCII values
- **Character Comparisons:** Single character comparisons
- **Type Coercion:** How JavaScript handles comparisons between different types

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
- String comparison order
- Character ASCII/Unicode ordering
- Mixed-type comparisons (numbers vs. strings)
- Behavior of comparison operators across different data types

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the files in Node.js:**
   ```bash
   node Operators.js
   node Comparison.js
   ```

2. **Run in Browser Console:**
   - Copy and paste the code into your browser's developer console (F12)
   - Observe the output in the console

3. **Learning Approach:**
   - Execute each file and review the console output
   - Compare the actual output with the comments
   - Experiment by modifying values and re-running

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### Operators.js Highlights
- JavaScript's automatic type coercion in arithmetic operations
- The unary plus (`+`) operator for type conversion
- Distinguishing between post and pre-increment/decrement
- Operator precedence rules

### Comparison.js Highlights
- How JavaScript compares strings lexicographically
- Type coercion in comparison operations
- Unexpected behaviors when comparing different types
- Unicode/ASCII value ordering

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript variables
- Familiarity with `console.log()` for output
- Node.js installed (or access to a browser console)

## 📝 Notes

- All examples include `console.log()` statements with expected output comments
- These are educational examples showing behavior, not production code
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for debugging type-related issues
